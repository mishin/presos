This is the _complete_ project that I used for the Spring Boot introduction
at FST (Facult√©s des Sciences de Tunis) on October 2014.

This project demonstrates various things that one can achieve very easily
with Boot. Check also a more descriptive description of the various
steps in the [bootero project][https://github.com/snicoll/presos/tree/master/bootero]

A MongoDB database on your local machine is required by default. Note that you can
tune the configuration if your installation deviate from the defaults. Check
[the documentation for more details][http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-mongodb],
in particular the `spring.data.mongodb.host` and `spring.data.mongodb.port`.
