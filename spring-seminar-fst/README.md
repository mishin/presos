This is the _complete_ project that I used for the Spring Boot introduction
at FST (Facult√©s des Sciences de Tunis) on October 2014.

This project demonstrates various things that one can achieve very easily
with Boot. Check also a more descriptive description of the various
steps in the [bootero project][https://github.com/snicoll/presos/tree/master/bootero]

A PostgreSQL database is required. By default, it connects to an instance running
on your local machine and use a "springtn" database. The "springtn" user with the
same for the password is required to connect. You can obviously tune the configuration
if your installation deviate from these settings. The database is created (or
updated) if necessary. Check [the documentation for more details][http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-database-initialization.html].
